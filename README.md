# RubiksCubeSolver
The objective of this project is to graphically represent a Rubik's cube and to find a solution for a given state. A rubik’s cube is a three dimensional puzzle; the goal is to correctly orient all pieces such that each of the six faces only has one colour occupying it. The cube is made up of corner pieces (with 3 sides) and edge pieces (with 2 sides). In any state, a cube has 12 possible turns: the clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of the six faces. This program uses predetermined patterns and pattern recognition to piece together a solution to any state of a cube. The process is divided into several steps: solving the bottom face, solving middle edges, solving the top edges and finally solving the top corners. The cube will be graphically displayed as it's geometric net and represented as a 2D array of values. A full solution is generated in both rubik’s cube notation and common language. This program currently generates solutions of approximately 100 quarter turns. In comparison, the optimal algorithm (Kociemba’s algorithm) can find a solution to any cube in 26 quarter turns or less.
